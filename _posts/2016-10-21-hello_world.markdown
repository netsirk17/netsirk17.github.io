<h2 class="pageTitle"> Hello world! </h2>

<p> Welcome to my blog. I will chronicle my adventures in data science throughout the course of my bootcamp.
</p>

<p> Please check out the various projects I've posted and feel free to contact me with comments, questions or issues. I hope you'll see my analyses grow increasingly sophisticated as time goes on and I learn more!
