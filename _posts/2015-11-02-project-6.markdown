<h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>

  <p><b> Dataset: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top" target="_blank"> IMDB Top 250 Films of All Time </a> </b></p>
  <p> The goal of the project was to examine what factors contribute to movie ratings in order to predict what types of movies a person may like. I used tree-based machine learning models on the top 250 films as rated by IMDB users to identify movie feature importance in determining user ratings. 
  </p>

  <p><b>Project Details</b>:
  <ol>
    <li> Webscrape information on top-rated films on IMDB and through OMDB API </li>
    <li> Create regression and classification models (decision trees and random forests) to determine most important movie features in predicting user ratings </li>
    <li>Cross validate model scores</li>
    <li>Models used:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>DecisionTree</li>
        <li>RandomForest</li>
        <li>ExtraTrees</li>
        <li>AdaBoost</li>
        <li>GradientBoosting</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Bagging and GridSearch were also used on certain models where appropriate </li>
  </ol>

<p> We have nearly endless choice in movies with Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO Now and many more on demand streaming services. But have you ever spent an entire night just browsing through the options and unable to land on anything? And the site algorithm keeps giving you terrible recommendations?
<br>
<br>
This is such a common phenomenon that even The Onion riffed on it with their segment <a href="http://www.theonion.com/video/netflix-introduces-new-browse-endlessly-plan-35308" target="_blank">"Netflix Introduces New 'Browse Endlessly' Plan"</a>. The report says, "the inexpensive new plan lets users just browse all the titles and posters they want for just five dollars a month."

I'm not advocating a less is more approach because we are way past that point. But it never hurts better curate to everyone's idiosyncratic tastes. Just because you love Tarantino's films doesn't mean you will like all kinds of blood-soaked violence intermixed with incessent yet indelible dialogue. But how can an algorithm recognize the gems without also suggesting irrelevent duds?
