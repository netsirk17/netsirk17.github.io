<h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>
  <p><b> Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data"> Titanic Database</a> </b></p>
  <p> The goal of the project is to predict the chances of any one passenger surviving the Titanic sinking of 1912, using various classification models to come to the best predictions. The best model turned out to be [  ] with [  ]% accuracy, [  ]% precision and a [  ]% false positive rate.
  </p>

  <p>Project Details:
  <ol>
    <li> Acquire data from AWL PostgreSQL database </li>
    <li> Create classification models to predict likelihood of survival </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Logistic Regression</li>
        <li>kNN Model</li>
        <li>Gridsearch to find optimal parameters for both models</li>
      </ul>
    <li> Examine models through confusion matrices and ROC curves </li>
  </ol>

  <p> This project was inspired by a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)">Kaggle competition</a><br>

<p> Remember that line from James Cameron's 1997 classic film <i>Titanic</i>? A chivalrous sentiment but apparently not maritime law in 1912. However, looking over the data it appears that most men honored the sentiment.

<p>There were nearly twice as many men as women who boarded the ship, but nearly twice as many women that survived than men.

<p>And looking at age groups (children are under 18, elderly over 40 and adults between 18-40), it looks like you were much more likely to die in the frigid water if you were an adult male.<br>
On the other hand, your chances of survival look much better (relative to other men) if you were a high-roller in 1st class.
