Irving Wladawsky-Berger, Wall Street Journal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/news/cio-journal">CIO Journal</a>
<p> And oldie but a goodie. Really breaks down the what and how of data science. In short, it’s all about the difference between explaining and predicting.
<blockquote>Data analysis has been generally used as a way of explaining some phenomenon by extracting interesting patterns from individual data sets with well-formulated queries. Data science, on the other hand, aims to discover and extract actionable knowledge from the data, that is, knowledge that can be used to make decisions and predictions, not just to explain what’s going on.
